what is data science data science is the study of data with the goal of extracting meaningful business insights it is a multidisciplinary approach that combines principles and practices from the fields of mathematics statistics artificial intelligence and computer engineering to analyze large amounts of data this analysis allows data scientists to ask and answer questions such as what happened why did it happen what will happen next and what can be done with the results why is data science important data science is important because it combines tools methods and technology to generate meaning from data modern organizations are awash with data there is a proliferation of devices that can automatically collect and store information online systems and payment gateways capture more data in the fields of ecommerce medicine finance and every other aspect of human life we have vast amounts of text audio video and image data at our disposal history of data science although the term data science is not new its meanings and connotations have changed over time the word first appeared in the s as an alternative name for statistics in the late s computing professionals formalized the term one proposed definition considered it to be an independent field with three aspects data design data collection and data analysis it took another decade for the term to be used outside academia future of data science artificial intelligence and machine learning innovations have made data processing faster and more efficient industry demand has created an ecosystem of courses degrees and jobs in the field of data science due to the multidisciplinary skill set and the necessary expertise data science promises strong growth in the coming decades what is data science used for data science is used to study data in four main ways descriptive analysis descriptive analytics examines data to gain insight into what has happened or is happening in the data environment it is characterized by data visualizations such as pie charts bar charts line charts tables or generated narratives for example a flight booking service records data such as the number of tickets booked each day descriptive analytics will reveal peaks and dips in bookings as well as the services highperforming months diagnostic analysis diagnostic analytics is a deep or detailed examination of data to understand why something happened it is characterized by techniques such as detailed analysis data discovery data mining or correlations various operations and transformations can be performed on a given data set in order to discover patterns unique to each of these techniques for example the flight service might do detailed analysis of a month with particularly high performance to better understand the peak in bookings this may reveal that many customers visit a certain city to attend a monthly sporting event predictive analysis predictive analytics uses historical data to make accurate predictions about data patterns that may occur in the future it is characterized by techniques such as machine learning forecasting pattern matching and predictive modeling in each of these techniques computers are trained to reverse engineer causal connections in the data for example the flight services team could use data science to predict the following years flight booking patterns at the beginning of each year the computer program or algorithm can examine past data and predict peak bookings for certain destinations in may by anticipating future customer travel needs the company could begin targeting those cities as early as february prescriptive analysis prescriptive analytics takes predictive data to the next level it doesnt just predict what is likely to happen it suggests an optimal response for that outcome it can analyze the possible implications of different alternatives and recommend the best course of action it uses graph analysis simulation complex event processing neural networks and machine learning recommendation engines going back to the flight booking example prescriptive analytics could examine historical marketing campaigns to maximize the advantage of the next booking spike a data scientist could project booking outcomes for different spending levels across various marketing channels these data forecasts give the flight booking company greater confidence in its marketing decisions what are the benefits of data science for businesses data science is revolutionizing how businesses operate many businesses regardless of size need a robust data science strategy to drive growth and maintain a competitive advantage some key benefits include discover unknown patterns of transformation data science enables companies to discover new patterns and relationships that have the potential to transform the organization it can reveal lowcost changes in resource management for maximum impact on profit margins for example an ecommerce company uses data science to discover that too many customer inquiries are generated outside of business hours research reveals that customers are more likely to purchase if they receive a quick response rather than a response the next day by implementing customer service the company increases its revenue by innovate with new products and solutions data science can reveal gaps and problems that would otherwise go unnoticed better insights into purchasing decisions customer feedback and business processes can drive innovation in internal operations and external solutions for example an online payment solution uses data science to collate and analyze customer comments about the company on social media analytics reveal that customers forget passwords during peak shopping periods and are dissatisfied with the current password recovery system the company can innovate for a better solution and see a significant increase in customer satisfaction realtime optimization for businesses especially large ones it is a major challenge to respond to changing conditions in real time this can cause significant losses or disruptions to business activity data science can help companies predict changes and react optimally to different circumstances for example a truckbased shipping company uses data science to reduce downtime if trucks break down they identify routes and shift patterns that lead to faster breakdowns and adjust truck schedules they also build an inventory of common spare parts that need to be replaced frequently so that trucks can be repaired
